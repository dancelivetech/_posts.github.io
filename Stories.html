 <font color="violet">Purple   <font color="Black"> dinos are awesome. They eat only candy, that is why they are  <font color="violet"> Purple.
 <font color="Black"> But one <font color="violet"> Purple  <font color="Black"> dino got tired of all the candy (hard to believe right?) 
That <font color="violet"> Purple <font color="black"> dino wanted to eat pizza.
 When he ate the pizza he turned yellow with red spots.  
 When his <font color="violet"> Purple  <font color="Black"> mom found out the now yellow and red dino got into trouble.
 His mom said that <font color="violet"> Purple <font color="Black">dinos only ate candy since the dawn of time. But yellow and red dino
     thought that dinosurs should try more food. I mean come on there are so many foods out there, <br/>
      <ul>
      <li>Stake</li>
      <li>Alfrado</li>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
     and so many more! The little dino wanted to try all of them! So the little dino did! He tried all of them, and he loved it! The little dino kept changing colors
     with all the food he tried, so it was hard to keep track of what he ate. But no one cared as long as he was<font color="violet"> Purple   <font color="Black">again!
       And he loved it. The End.<img src="./Purple_Dino.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt""/>
